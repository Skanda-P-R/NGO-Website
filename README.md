# NGO-Website
In this Buildathon Challege, we were asked to create a front-end static webpage for and NGO called Grameena Unnathi Society. They provided with the information to be added in the website, using which we created a front-end website.

Since we had given a Contact Us page in the webpage, we decided to add a database which stores the Name, Email ID and the customer's Message, so that the society can contact them afterwards.
